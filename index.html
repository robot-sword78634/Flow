    <h2>What is Flow?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Flow</strong> is a small, friendly, educational programming language inspired by
        classic 1970s and early 1980s computing. It is designed to make programming approachable,
        readable, and fun.
    </p>
    <p> Flow leans heavily into the simplicity of early programming languages such as BASIC, but
        utilizes a model based on visual flowchart logic rather than line numbers. The language
        is equipped with a robust set of mathematical functions that should suit most users' needs
        and is capable of handling simple string variables. The idea behind the creation of Flow was to create
        an interpreted language that was low barrier for individuals who were new to programming
        and would inspire them to push the language's limitations to build new and interesting things.
        In short, to create a "friendly" language that would inspire wonder and interest in learning
        programming concepts. Essentially the same experience I had when first sitting in front of 
        a computer in 1984 and realizing that I now had a set of tools that I could use to create 
        whatever I could imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flow encourages learning through experimentation, creativity, and play rather than
        complexity or performance.

    <h2>Downloading & Compiling Flow</h2>
    <p>
        Clone the Flow repository from GitHub:
    </p>

    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/robot-sword78634/flow.git
cd flow</code></pre>

    <p>
        Compile the interpreter (example using g++):
    </p>

    <pre><code>g++ -std=c++11 flow.cpp -o flow</code></pre>

    <p>
        (Adjust filenames and compiler options as needed for your system.)
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Hello World in Flow</h2>
    <p>Create a simple text file called <code>hello.flow</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>print "Hello, world!"</code></pre>

    <p>Run it using the Flow interpreter:</p>

    <pre><code>./flow hello.flow</code></pre>

    <p>
        Congratulations — you’ve written your first Flow program!

    <h2>The History of Flow</h2>
    <ul>
    <p>The development of Flow grew out of both a modest success and a spectacular failure.
    I had some limited success creating a simple Lisp interpreter, followed by a frustrating
    attempt to expand my skills by building a modern version of BASIC. That experience led 
    me to realize that a more approachable project would be to design a language that captured
    the best ideas from early programming languages, combined with a small selection of concepts
    that make modern languages more accessible.</p>
    <p>As I began mapping out Flow, it became clear that a language which reads more like pseudocode
    than traditional source code could serve as a useful teaching tool for introducing people to 
    computer programming. Much of Flow's syntax consists of simplified, stripped-down versions
    of constructs found in modern languages, with the goal that programs should "flow" naturally,
    much like the logic paths in a flowchart</p>
    <p>Flow is written in C++ and implemented as an interpreted language. This makes it portable,
    easy to experiment with, and approachable for learners, without requiring them to get too 
    close to the underlying hardware or system details.</p>
    <p>Some future ideas for implementation include:</p>
        <li>Expanding ASCII output abilities</li>
        <li>Adding a wait function</li>
        <li>Implementing arrays/lists</li>
        <li>Building the ability to create user defined functions</li>
    </ul>
