    <h2>What is Flow?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Flow</strong> is a small, friendly, educational programming language inspired by
        classic 1970s and early 1980s computing. It is designed to make programming approachable,
        readable, and fun.
    </p>
    <p> Flow leans heavily into the simplicity of early programming languages such as BASIC, but
        utilizes a model based on visual flow chart logic rather than line numbers. The language
        is equipted with a robust set of mathematical functions that should suit most users needs
        and is capable of handling simple string variables. The idea behind the creation of Flow was to create
        an interpreted language that was low barrier for individuals who were new to programming
        and would inspire them to push the language's limitations to build new and interesting things.
        In short, to create a "friendly" language that would inspire wonder and interest in learning
        about more complicated concepts. Essentially the same experience I had when first sitting
        in front of a computer in 1984 and realizing that I now had a set of tools that I could
        use to create anything I wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Flow encourages learning through experimentation, creativity, and play rather than
        complexity or performance.

    <h2>Downloading & Compiling Flow</h2>
    <p>
        Clone the Flow repository from GitHub:
    </p>

    <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/robot-sword78634/flow.git
cd flow</code></pre>

    <p>
        Compile the interpreter (example using g++):
    </p>

    <pre><code>g++ -std=c++11 flow.cpp -o flow</code></pre>

    <p>
        (Adjust filenames and compiler options as needed for your system.)
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Hello World in Flow</h2>
    <p>Create a simple text file called <code>hello.flow</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>print "Hello, world!"</code></pre>

    <p>Run it using the Flow interpreter:</p>

    <pre><code>./flow hello.flow</code></pre>

    <p>
        Congratulations — you’ve written your first Flow program!
    </p>
